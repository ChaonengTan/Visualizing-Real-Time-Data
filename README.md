# FEW 2.5 Real time data project 

This repo contains some starter code you can use to get started on your real time data exploration. 

The code in this repo creates an audio visualizer built with JavaScript. 

## Getting started 

The repo contains HTML and JS files along with a couple sample sound files. Since the sounds are loaded from the file:/// route you'll get a CORS error if you open the HTML from your desktop. To solve this be sure to run the files from a local server. If you're using VSCode install LiveServer. 

## Editing the code
